# Chemthunder
I'm a funky idiotic and often stupid Minecraft Fabric mod developer with a love for reading, writing, and acting.

I'm currently a member of Basically Content SMP by DexFlex_YT, and Memory Lapse by AcoYT.

I have big dreams of making something people will remember I guess.

## Current Interests
