## Chemthunder
I'm a funky idiotic and often stupid Minecraft Fabric mod developer with a love for reading, writing, and acting.

I'm currently a member of Basically Content SMP by DexFlex_YT, and Memory Lapse by AcoYT.

I have big dreams of making something people will remember I guess.

## Currently Working on:
Herald - 1.21.1 <> BCSMP
A lore weaponry and character mod for Season Seven

Northstar - 1.21.1 <> Memory Lapse
Flamethrowers, big swords, and Oil!
